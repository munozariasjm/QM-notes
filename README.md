# Quantum Mechanics notes

This repository contains notes for QM courses. The main idea is to cover basics of QM, applied QM and QM for quantum computing.

## Contents

The notes are divided into three parts:

1.  **Basic QM**
    1. TODO: add contents

2.  **Applied QM**
    1.  [Scattering Theory](./notes/02_Applied_QM/01_scattering/00_th_scattering.ipynb)
    2.  [Perturbation theory](./notes/02_Applied_QM/02_perturbation/00_th_pert_theory.ipynb)
    3.  [Hydrogen atom](./notes/02_Applied_QM/03_Hydrogen%20StructureÂ¨)

3.  **Quantum Systems and Information**
    1. [Preliminaries](./notes/03_Quantum_Systems/00_preliminary/intro.ipynb)
    2. State Spaces
        1. [Density operators](./notes/03_Quantum_Systems/01_State_Space/00_density_operartors.ipynb)
        2. [Bloch Sphere](./notes/03_Quantum_Systems/01_State_Space/01_bloch_sphere.ipynb)
        3. [Composite Systems](./notes/03_Quantum_Systems/01_State_Space/02_composite_systems.ipynb)
        4. [Entanglement](./notes/03_Quantum_Systems/01_State_Space/04_entanglement.ipynb)
        5. [Spectral decomposition](./notes/03_Quantum_Systems/01_State_Space/05_spectral_decomposition.ipynb)

## How to use

The notes are written in Jupyter notebooks. To view them, you can use simply use GitHub's built-in notebook viewer. To run them, you need to install Jupyter notebook. The easiest way to do this is to install [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads). Anaconda is available for Linux, OS X and Windows and contains all the necessary libraries and software to run the notebooks.
