    "In this chapter, we will discuss composite systems in quantum information, focusing on key concepts such as tensor products, reduced states, partial trace, and purification of quantum states. Understanding these concepts is essential for studying entanglement, quantum communication, and other fundamental topics in quantum information theory.\n",

    "## What is a composite system?\n",
    "\n",
    "From before, we have only considered a single state $\\ket{\\psi}$ in a single Hilbert space $\\mathcal{H}$. However, in quantum information, we often want to consider multiple systems at once. For example, we may want to consider the state of two qubits, or the state of a qubit and a classical bit. In these cases, we need to consider a composite system.\n",
    "\n",
    "One important aspect of composite systems is entanglement, which occurs when the wave function of the composite system cannot be factorized into separate wave functions for each subsystem. This means that the state of each subsystem is not well-defined on its own, but rather is only defined in relation to the state of the other subsystems. Entanglement can lead to some unusual and counterintuitive effects, such as non-local correlations between distant subsystems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Composite systems are of great interest in quantum information theory, where they are used to study quantum communication, quantum computation, and quantum cryptography. In particular, entangled composite systems are a crucial resource for many quantum information protocols, and understanding how to create and manipulate entanglement is an important area of research in this field."

    "## Tensor products basics\n",

    "The tensor product, denoted by $\\otimes$, is an operation that combines two vector spaces or Hilbert spaces to create a new, larger space. Given two Hilbert spaces $\\mathcal{H}_A$ and $\\mathcal{H}_B$, their tensor product is denoted as $\\mathcal{H}_A \\otimes \\mathcal{H}_B$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose $\\mathcal{H}_A$ and $\\mathcal{H}_B$ have bases ${|a_i\\rangle}$ and ${|b_j\\rangle}$, respectively. The basis for the composite space $\\mathcal{H}_A \\otimes \\mathcal{H}_B$ is formed by the tensor products of basis elements, i.e., ${|a_i\\rangle \\otimes |b_j\\rangle}$, which can also be written as ${|a_i b_j\\rangle}$.\n",

    "3. For scalar multiplication, $$(\\alpha |\\psi\\rangle) \\otimes |\\phi\\rangle = |\\psi\\rangle \\otimes (\\alpha |\\phi\\rangle) = \\alpha (|\\psi\\rangle \\otimes |\\phi\\rangle).$$\n",

    "5. For the operator $A$ on $\\mathcal{H}_A$ and $B$ on $\\mathcal{H}_B$, the tensor product of $A$ and $B$ is defined as $A \\otimes B$ on $\\mathcal{H}_A \\otimes \\mathcal{H}_B$ by $$(A \\otimes B) (|\\psi\\rangle \\otimes |\\phi\\rangle) = (A |\\psi\\rangle) \\otimes (B |\\phi\\rangle).$$"
